      <p>You can create anything that makes you happy. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.</p>

      <p>I'm a water fanatic. I love water. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. We'll play with clouds today. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.</p>

      <p>For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. See there, told you that would be easy. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. With practice comes confidence. Let's do that again.</p>

      <p>Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Let's get crazy. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck.</p>

      <p>The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. All kinds of happy little splashes.</p>

      <p>Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Work that paint. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.</p>

      <p>Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. This is truly an almighty mountain. A beautiful little sunset. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.</p>
